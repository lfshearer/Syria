**Syria has 14 governorates, or district 1 levels; there are 60 districts, or district 2 levels. Highlighted in orange are the districts of Jarablus and A'zaz located in the governorate of Aleppo. The aforementioned are the districts I chose to focus on throughout the project.**

**By far the most highly populated governorate is Aleppo. It holds 23.2% of Syria's total population. However, it's density is only a moderate size at 302.41 persons/km^2. Damascus, although only having 8.0% of Syria's total population, has the highest density at 17698.61 persons/km^2. The two most highly populated cities in Syria are Aleppo, with about 1.6 million inhabitants, and Damascus (the capital), with about 1.55 million inhavitants. The difference in density arises because of the massive surface area of Aleppo contrary to that of Damascus.**
